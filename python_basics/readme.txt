Irregular Beat Generator Documentation

This Python script allows you to create custom beats by specifying parameters like BPM, measures, time signature, and sample choice. It plays the generated beat and optionally saves it as a MIDI file.

Rhythm Generation Strategy:
- The rhythm generation strategy divides the total number of beats into 2s and 3s to create a diverse rhythm pattern.
- The base rhythm is filled with different layers: the middle layer (snare) follows the base rhythm, the low layer (kick) plays at twice the speed of the middle layer, and the high layer (hihat) plays at four times the speed of the base rhythm.

Focus Areas:
- The primary focus during development was on learning Python and user interface (UI) design.
- The rhythm generation algorithm was kept simple to emphasize the learning process.

Takeaways:
- This project provided valuable insights into Python programming.
- Concepts introduced during the course were new and required learning.
